- Dareech Seetohul & Ryan Kiel Baluyut

In linux terminal: 
1. go to folder location (cd dir)
2. enter command "gprolog" to start gprolog
3. inside of gprolog open file with command "[prolog]."
*File is now open and running*

to exit gprolog type "halt."

Instructions for calculator: 

Adding two numbers:
"add(1,2,N)."
where 1 is your first number
      2 is the second number
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "add(5,2,N)." returns N = (5+2) = 7
      

Subtracting two numbers:
"sub(1,2,N)."
where 1 is your first number
      2 is the second number
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "sub(5,2,N)." returns N = (5-2) = 3      


Multiply two numbers:
"mult(1,2,N)."
where 1 is your first number
      2 is the second number
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "add(5,2,N)." returns N = (5*2) = 10


Divide two numbers:
"div(1,2,N)."
where 1 is your first number
      2 is the second number
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "add(5,2,N)." returns N = (5/2) = 2.5
      
Logarithm:
"logbN(N,B,X)."
where B is your base
      N is the number of
      and X is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "logbN(1000,10,X)." returns X = 3
      
Log examples to try for whole number results
log base 7 of 49 
log base 10 of 1000
log base 8 of 64 
log base 9 of 9 

Factorial:
"factorial(1,N)."
where 1 is your number
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "factorial(5,N)." returns N = 120
      
Power:
"power(1,2,N)."
where 1 is your number
      2 is your exponent
      and N is a fixed variable (use any letter but not a number)
      i.e "power(5,2,N)." returns N = 25
